* Certain sections of the code are not optimized.
 
## FAQ

### How can I incorporate an audio cue for successful hits?

Establish a "hitsounds" directory within the main Counter-Strike Global Offensive folder. Introduce any number of .wav audio files into this directory. Activate the cheat, and the hitsounds will be accessible through the hitsounds combobox.

### Where are configuration files located?

Profiles reside within the primary Counter-Strike Global Offensive directory, housed in a folder labeled "profiles."

Sharing profiles with friends involves accessing the configuration tab within the cheat and opting for Export. This action duplicates all profile data to the clipboard, which you can subsequently share with your friend.

To import a profile, simply copy all profile data and click on Import. Remember to safeguard your profile by assigning a name and selecting Save.
